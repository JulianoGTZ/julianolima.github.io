## My Blog

Hi folks o/

This is the repository of my blog using React, Jest and Gatsby :rocket:. Honorable Mention to [Lumen](https://lumen.netlify.com/), which was the main tool used, which accumulates the other technologies that the project uses.

If you want to know more about these technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

This README is still poor regarding documentation details, but it is still the **beginning .... of a great journey**.

As the [agile manifesto]((https://agilemanifesto.org/):) suggests:

```
Working software over comprehensive documentation
```

Have a good reading.
