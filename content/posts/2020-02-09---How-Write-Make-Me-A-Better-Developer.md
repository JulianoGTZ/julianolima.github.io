**Hello, Welcome**. This is the pilot post of my blog, the first article of many that I'm going to post here :)

I decided as the first subject to address the main motivation of the Blog: **Transmitting knowledge through writing.** This is one of the points that help me to evolve personally and professionally and I'm going to explain why.

## Why Every Programmer is a Potential Writer

I like to think that just as the Sumerians in the ancient Mesopotamian civilization (present-day Iraq) revolutionized the way society transmitted knowledge **through the invention of writing**, **programmers are also revolutionizing writing almost like the scribes of our time**. With the inevitable insertion of technology in all areas of society, those who are programming are synthesizing in code the problems, solutions, desires and limitations that we are currently living.

**This is not an easy assignment**. Whether naming variables, functions, classes, methods, or describing a pull-request, I'm always doing the exercise of transmitting an idea, or I'm reading a code snippet to understand someone else's idea.

### Remember that your code should be clear to you and your coworkers. Code is not a diary.

The exercise of putting myself in the shoes of someone who will read and try to interpret helps me find good points for improvement in everything I develop, whether that person is a coworker, friend, teacher, or **my future self**.
## Software development is not just writing code

Programming is a big challenge and requires a lot of technical studies to clearly express your idea using the best resources of a given language. *But is programming just coding?*

In my opinion, **no**. Software development is not only about programming, **but it is also about understanding the problem outside the computer bits**. 

To code better you need to have a broad vision about the reason that you're coding like: **the business problem**, **the stakeholder's motivation**, **what value this development is bringing?**, etc.

Talking a little bit about set theory, the programmer is at the **intersection** between the concrete world of business and the abstract world of software implementations.
![Intersection between software developer with the world of business and technology](/media/developer-intersection.png)

Part of my job as a software developer is to transmit the ideas that round development in a clear and concrete way to all *stakeholders*. The problem understanding and good communication optimize the required effort by everyone involved.

## How can I improve my writing skill?

Often as a developer, I need to synthesize complex and abstract content into **concrete** and **palpable** concepts. How to explain it?

### Visual Elements and Analogies> Buzzwords

In general software developers have their own dialect full of acronyms such as: *Docker*, *Kubernetes*, *Git*, *Deploy*, *ETL*, among many others. This communication is extremely efficient among the initiates of that language but **it is extremely complex for those who are not**. It is very important to know who your target audience is and if they are familiar with these terms.

Analogies are a great alternative to help materialize complex concepts. They are extremely effective in familiarizing strange terms by opening a parallel with something in the person's reality.

Visual elements like diagrams are a very powerful tool for presenting complex ideas in an agnostic way of technology. Some solutions like [Miro](https://miro.com/) provide a wide range of diagrams and tools to make an interactive presentation.

### Reading

This is the best tip I can give to someone who wants to write well: **Read a lot**! 

Reading books and articles from different subjects gives to me a lot of intellectual input to transmit ideas with different approaches. I usually try to add to my utility belt every analogy or example that makes me understand some concept.
## Writing well is even more valuable in distributed teams

In times of remote work in which we have distributed teams, there is a natural tendency for many meetings to align assignments and expectations, especially in places where remote work was far from being a reality.

Without face-to-face contact we lose some elements of communication such as body language, but at the same time we have more opportunities to improve our written communication. A very concise text can save you from long meetings, long contextualizations and **can save a lot of your focus time in the day**.

Briefly writing the description of the meeting for the participants or stressing some issues/hypotheses asynchronously for an eventual meeting to be more productive has been very effective for me.
## Writing better = coding better

I realize that as I’m trying to improve my writing skill I'm also improving my ability to deliver software and solve problems. The exercise of **writing** and **reading** increasingly enriches my mental map of how to develop solutions, whether coding or understanding problems.

Not all writing needs to be in articles, blogs and magazines. you can start at:
* In your team's communication channels
* Pull-request descriptions 
* Commit messages
* In the README of the project you are working on.
* ~~A polemic post on twitter~~
