## Where I from, What I Do, Where I live

Hi, my name is Juliano Pereira Lima. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [UNIVALI](https://www.univali.br/graduacao/ciencia-da-computacao-itajai). A relevant part of my graduation was also done at [UEMS](https://www.comp.uems.br/).

I'm from **Mato-Grosso do Sul**. Currently, I'm living in SÃ£o Paulo, Capital.

I'm software Engineer at Nubank, working specifically in Back-End using Clojure in a [very plural architecture](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/nubank-architecture/). I have worked with Java, C#, and React in past jobs, and sometimes I still develop some stuff with these technologies (mostly for fun).

I love the **Science** in the Computer Science. I usually study through textbooks, presentations, events, own experiments, and scientific articles trying to understand more about the theory behind everything happening technologically in the world.

The biggest obstacles I have experienced professionally led me to study Agile. I love to study this topic, including organizational structures. This knowledge greatly increases my breadth of problem-solving and helps me a lot to develop what is really necessary.

I like to contribute to the community by participating in [Meetups](https://youtu.be/1RFgwFJ73rc), writting on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/julianogtz) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@julianodgtz) and contributing to open source for projects like [Sweet Alert 2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) and [Dev.to](http://dev.to/)

I love burgers, movies, different types of beer, football(especially **Corinthians**), and Non-Sense Cartoons.

I'm a fan of **pair-programming**. Usually, I'm programming with **Jorge**.
